//! iracing-telem is a rust port of the iRacing provided c++ SDK.
//!
//! It allows for access to telemetetry data from a running instance of the iRacing simulator
//! As well as the ability to send certain control messages to the simulator (e.g to change
//! Pitstop settings)
//!
//! The iRacing data is exposed through a memory mapped file. Because of this, and the potential
//! issue for the data to not be in the expected locations almost all methods are marked as unsafe.
//!
//! Details of the c++ SDK are available on the iRacing forums. Note you will need an active
//! iRacing subsription to access these.
//!
